<p>

 <h2>Steps:</h2> 
  <ol>
    <li>Imported Excel file from desktop to google spreadsheets</li>
    <li>Changed the name of the file on Google Spreadsheets</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The "Car Sales Database" is a neatly structured spreadsheet intended for monitoring and evaluating vehicle sales information. Individual car sales are   represented by the rows, and certain characteristics or data points related to each sale are represented by the columns. Because of the database's design, every transaction is reliably documented, facilitating efficient data analysis.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Duplicates, Vlookup, P - Worksheet</h2>

<img src="https://github.com/nushratea/Project-Data/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20Examples/Car%20Sales%20Project%20-%20Google%20Spreadsheets/Task%202%20-%20Duplicates%2C%20Vlookup%2C%20P.png">Task 2 - Duplicates, Vlookup, P - Worksheet</a>

<h2>Descprition:</h2>
<p>In the context of data analysis, managing and organizing large datasets is crucial for generating meaningful insights. This specific task from the Car Sales Project focuses on utilizing Google Sheets to handle common data management challenges, such as identifying duplicates and using lookup functions to streamline data integration. These techniques are especially relevant in scenarios where multiple datasets need to be cross-referenced or when data integrity is paramount.</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<h3>Focusing on task 2 worksheet:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Removed duplicate values first (select desired column —— menu panel — data — remove duplicates)</li>
    <li>Removed blanks (select desire column — menu panel — create filter — filer by condition — “is empty” — okay. Spreadsheet will located all blanks for that column — select the rows — right click — delete selected rows — click the filter sign on the right side of the column name to un-filter or unselect “filter by condition = none” — okay — spreadsheet should show current column view) repeat as many times as needed.</li>
    <li>Un-filtered all the columns (menu panel — data — remove filter)</li>
    <li> VLOOKUP function used to insert values, to paste the formula vertically, drag the little + sign at the end of the select textbox down. Values should automatically appear.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Creating a Pivot Table:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Menu panel — insert — pivot table — data range (current table) — existing  sheet — create (P. table will be inserted)</li>
    <li>Selected countries as rows</li>
    <li>Selected order numbers as values (summarized by count)</li>
    <li>Selected product line as columns</li>
    <li>Formatted the finished table</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Task 3 - Basic Charts</h2>

<h2>Descprition:</h2>

<p>The image titled "Task 3 - Basic Charts" from "Car Sales Project" in Google Spreadsheets showcases a series of basic yet informative charts designed to visualize car sales data. The charts include bar charts, line graphs, or pie charts, each representing different aspects of the sales data, such as sales figures by model, sales trends over time, or market share distribution among various brands.</p>

<p>These charts are essential for providing a clear and concise overview of the data, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. For instance, a bar chart may compare the sales of different car models, highlighting which models are the top sellers, while a line chart could show sales trends over months or years, indicating seasonality or growth patterns. A pie chart might depict the market share of different car brands, giving a quick snapshot of their relative performance.</p>

<p>Overall, this visual representation aids in understanding the car sales data, facilitating data-driven decision-making. It demonstrates how basic charts can effectively convey complex information, making it accessible and actionable for stakeholders.</p>
