<h1>Understanding Data with Tableau</h1>

<p>Here are a few Tableau dashboards I've demonstrated using publicly available datasets. You can access any Tableau Workbook by clicking on the URL located at the bottom of each one. You are welcome to view the dashboard pictures below. For a list of all available workbooks, do see my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nushrate.ahmed/vizzes">Tableau Public Homepage</a>.</p>

<h2>CO2 Emission by Year</h2>

<ul><li>Workbook Name: CO2 Emission by Year</li>
<li>Dataset: Exported from Excel Worksheet CO2 Emissions, Population, Energy, and GDP</li>
<li>Link: <a href="[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nushrate.ahmed/viz/GlobalCO2Emissions_17246291969680/Sheet1#1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nushrate.ahmed/viz/CO2EmissionbyYear_17246383922260/CO2EmissionbyYear#1)">CO2 Emission by Year</a></li></ul><br>

<p>The CO2 emissions by nation and year are contrasted in this worksheet. Three separate spreadsheets including data on GDP, population, and energy were merged using the country name and year. The final spreadsheet was created by filtering by Year and using Country as the category for CO2 per capita. The CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2011 are contrasted in the first image. Only the year 2000's CO2 emissions are shown in the second visual. </p>
