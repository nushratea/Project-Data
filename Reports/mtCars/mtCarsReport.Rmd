## 1. Introduction

This report explores motor trend car road tests using the dataset 'mtcars'. Specifically, it focuses on the "mileages", 
the "number of cylinders", and "weight" of cars. The report was generated using [**rmarkdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

```{r}
#Create nicely formatted tables
kable(head(mtcars), caption = "First few rows of the mtcars dataset.")
```

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Now, we look at mileage by weight and the number of cylinders of cars. Lighter cars also tend to have
four cylinders and higher milages. 

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig. height=3, fig.cap="Lighter Cars Have Less Number of Cylinders and High Mileages."}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color=factor(cyl)))+
geom_point() +
labs(x="Weight (1000 lbs)", y= "Miles per Gallon", color="Cylinders", title="Mileage by Weight and Cylinders")
```

## 3. Conclusions

In this analysis, we explored three variables in the `mtcars` dataset:

- `mpg`: miles per gallon
- `cyl`: number of cylinders
- `weight`: weight in 1000lbs

From our exploratory data analysis, we saw that there are trends between the number of cylinders a car has and its mileage as well as its weight. Cars with more cylinders are likely heavier, so it makes more sense that we saw in the scatter plot that cars with 8 cylinders were often heavier. Additionally, in general, these heavier cars with more cylinders have lower mileage.
